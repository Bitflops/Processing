Mars Rover is an application written in Processing which displays the locations of the NASA Mars rovers on mars' surface with the possibility to change the surface texture of the planet by pressing the keys 1 through 4.

The ultimate goal is to populate the map with further mars mission landers (former and future).

The small app can be run in processing by downloading the sketch and the data folder with the textures images or as standalone application for Linux, Mac and Windows by downloading the respective folder on the download page.  

I you like to contact me or have development suggestions visit the <a href=https://forum.processing.org/topic/mars-globe-with-nasa-rovers>
the related thread</a> on the processing forum.


Enjoy Space Exploration and Regards.
